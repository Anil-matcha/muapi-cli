## ✨ Introduction

Welcome to the **Awesome Astra** high-signal use-case repository.

This collection tracks practical workflows, prompts, integrations, evaluations, and safety notes for **GPT-6 Astra**, OpenAI’s flagship model for difficult end-to-end work. The initial edition is deliberately first-party led: every entry is grounded in OpenAI’s current model guidance, API documentation, or published safety material.

The repository uses **Astra** as the short name and **GPT-6 Astra** when the exact model name matters. The current API model identifier is `gpt-6-astra`.

> Snapshot reviewed: **September 4, 2026.** Model access, prices, limits, and product behavior can change. Re-check the linked OpenAI documentation before relying on any detail in production.

## 🧭 Read First

- Treat `reasoning.effort` as a workload control. Start with `low` for cost-sensitive tool use and compare `medium` or higher for agentic coding, research, and judgement-heavy work.
- Use the Responses API for tool calling. Chat Completions is supported, but function calling with Astra requires Responses.
- Astra can continue work while an asynchronous tool runs, accept mid-turn steering, and change reasoning effort mid-conversation through `configuration_update` items.
- Audit `AGENTS.md`, skills, tools, and other instruction files available to the model. OpenAI notes that Astra follows long instructions more strongly and can be more sensitive to those files.
- Keep computer-use workflows isolated, permissioned, observable, and reversible. The API documentation explicitly warns that computer use can affect real accounts and data.
- Read the [Astra safety overview](https://openai.com/index/safety-overview-gpt-6-astra/) before planning cybersecurity or high-impact automation.

## ⚡ Quick API Access

Use the official OpenAI Responses API. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell, then run:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-6-astra",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"},
    "instructions": "Be precise. State assumptions and verify important claims.",
    "input": "Design a test plan for a production database migration."
  }'
```

Python equivalent:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-6-astra",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},
    instructions="Be precise. State assumptions and verify important claims.",
    input="Design a test plan for a production database migration.",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

See the [official reasoning examples](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning) and [Responses API migration guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/migrate-to-responses) for production request patterns.

<a id="coding-and-software-engineering"></a>
## 💻 Coding and Software Engineering

<a id="case-1"></a>
### Case 1: [Hardest End-to-End Work](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model)

**Use Astra when one task crosses architecture, code, browsing, tools, and professional software.**

OpenAI positions GPT-6 Astra for computer use, browsing, software engineering, science, and professional work. The useful pattern is to give it the outcome, repository or system context, constraints, and acceptance checks, then let it choose the sequence of work.

**Prompt pattern:**

```text
Goal:
<the outcome that must be true when the task is complete>

Context:
<repository, system, users, interfaces, constraints, and known risks>

Tools:
<the tools it may use and what each tool is allowed to change>

Definition of done:
<tests, screenshots, logs, metrics, or review criteria>

Work in stages. Inspect before editing, state assumptions that affect the result,
verify every meaningful change, and report evidence at the end.
```

**Evidence:** Official model guidance · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="case-2"></a>
### Case 2: [Long-Horizon Coding with Verification](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model)

**Use Astra for multi-file implementation, migrations, difficult debugging, and changes that require repeated tests.**

OpenAI’s guidance says Astra is stronger at staying coherent during long tasks and tends to be thorough about testing. Make verification part of the request: name the focused tests, the broader checks, and the evidence that should be returned before the task is considered complete.

**Useful handoff:** ask for a decision-complete plan first, then request implementation in a separate turn with the plan, acceptance criteria, and test commands attached.

**Evidence:** Official model guidance · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="case-3"></a>
### Case 3: [Large-Context Repository Review](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models)

**Use the 1.05M-token context window for codebase-wide review when the risk is distributed across modules, interfaces, or historical decisions.**

Start with an inventory of the repository and the narrow question the review must answer. Ask for file-backed findings, severity ordering, reproduction or verification steps, and explicit uncertainty. A large context window helps with coverage; it does not replace tests, security review, or domain expertise.

**Prompt nudge:**

```text
Review the repository before proposing edits. Every finding must cite a file,
symbol, or command. Separate confirmed defects from hypotheses. Do not fix
anything until the root cause and the smallest safe change are clear.
```

**Evidence:** Model specification · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="tools-agents-and-orchestration"></a>
## 🧰 Tools, Agents, and Orchestration

<a id="case-4"></a>
### Case 4: [Async Tool Orchestration](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/async-tool-calling)

**Start slow lookups early while Astra continues independent reasoning or completes another part of the response.**

Async tool calling is useful when a workflow combines independent data sources, long-running analysis, or a user-facing progress stream. Set `async: true` on supported function or custom tool definitions, execute the tool in your application, and return the result using the original `call_id`.

**Design rule:** asynchronous execution changes when a result arrives; your application still owns authorization, execution, retries, timeouts, and side effects.

**Evidence:** Official async tool-calling guide · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="case-5"></a>
### Case 5: [Mid-Turn Steering for Changing Requirements](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/steering)

**Send a correction while a long-running response is still working instead of restarting the whole task.**

Mid-turn steering is a fit for agentic workflows where a user changes scope, clarifies a requirement, or asks the model to stop before a side effect. Use a WebSocket connection and preserve the completed work returned in the continuation. Keep steering instructions explicit about what should remain valid and what must change.

**Example instruction:** “Keep the completed inventory and analysis. Stop before writing files, and revise the implementation plan to support the new data-retention requirement.”

**Evidence:** Official mid-turn steering guide · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="case-6"></a>
### Case 6: [Dynamic Reasoning Effort](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning)

**Use lower effort for routine follow-ups and increase it only when the task becomes difficult.**

Astra supports `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. OpenAI documents `configuration_update` for changing effort between responses while preserving the original prompt prefix for caching. This makes a useful relay: triage at `low`, investigate at `medium` or `high`, and reserve the highest settings for work where the additional quality is measurable.

**Important:** do not send `none`; Astra rejects that reasoning effort with HTTP 400. Do not put two `configuration_update` items next to each other, and validate the compatibility limits before combining this feature with compaction or truncation.

**Evidence:** Official reasoning guide · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="case-7"></a>
### Case 7: [Tool-Calling Agent with a Stable Contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model)

**Give an agent a small, typed tool surface and an explicit completion contract.**

For Astra, use the Responses API when the workflow needs function calling, web search, file search, or computer use. Define each tool’s authorization boundary, input schema, timeout, retry policy, and user-visible side effects. Ask the model to explain what it needs from each tool and to stop at approval boundaries.

**Evidence:** Official model guidance and API model catalog · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="research-files-and-professional-work"></a>
## 🔎 Research, Files, and Professional Work

<a id="case-8"></a>
### Case 8: [Search- and File-Grounded Research](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models)

**Combine web search, file search, and long-context synthesis when the answer needs both current information and private source material.**

Separate the research phases: gather sources, extract claims, reconcile conflicts, and write the answer with citations or file references. Ask Astra to distinguish sourced facts, calculations, assumptions, and unresolved questions. The knowledge cutoff remains a property of the model; web search is the mechanism for current information.

**Evidence:** Official model catalog · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="case-9"></a>
### Case 9: [Professional Workflow with Clear Boundaries](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model)

**Use Astra as a collaborator for spreadsheets, slides, documents, analysis, and other professional software workflows when the task has a reviewable output.**

Describe the target artifact, audience, source of truth, formatting constraints, and review checklist. If the workflow can change external data, split it into inspect, propose, approve, and apply stages. Astra’s ability to infer routine gaps is useful, but consequential decisions still need a named reviewer.

**Evidence:** Official model guidance · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="computer-use-and-browser-workflows"></a>
## 🖥️ Computer Use and Browser Workflows

<a id="case-10"></a>
### Case 10: [Browser and Computer-Use QA](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)

**Use computer use to inspect a UI, reproduce a user journey, or run a bounded QA task inside an isolated environment.**

Start with a disposable account or test tenant. Give the agent a narrow objective, visible stop conditions, and a tool wrapper that blocks destructive actions by default. Capture screenshots and action logs, require confirmation before purchases, messages, deletion, or permission changes, and replay the run before trusting a fix.

OpenAI’s computer-use guide warns that these workflows can affect real accounts and data. Treat that warning as an implementation requirement, not a prompt suggestion.

**Evidence:** Official computer-use guide · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="cyber-defense-and-safety"></a>
## 🛡️ Cyber Defense and Safety

<a id="case-11"></a>
### Case 11: [Authorized Defensive Security with Daybreak](https://openai.com/index/daybreak-for-frontline-defenders/)

**Use Astra-class capabilities for defensive security only inside an authorized, monitored, and isolated program.**

OpenAI’s Daybreak initiative describes defensive work such as reviewing legacy code and configurations, analyzing suspicious activity, identifying and validating vulnerabilities, prioritizing risks, and developing and testing fixes. The initiative distinguishes Daybreak Blue for common defensive work from Daybreak Red for approved organizations handling more sensitive work.

This repository intentionally does not include exploit chains, intrusion playbooks, or instructions for targeting systems. Contributors should submit safe, reproducible defensive workflows with authorization assumptions and rollback steps.

**Evidence:** OpenAI Daybreak announcement · **Date:** 2026-09-03

<a id="case-12"></a>
### Case 12: [Safety, Alignment, and Monitorability Evaluation](https://openai.com/index/safety-overview-gpt-6-astra/)

**Evaluate capability and control together before giving Astra tools or access to consequential systems.**

OpenAI reports stronger safeguards, broader misalignment monitoring, better prompt-injection resistance, and improved adherence to safety boundaries. The same safety overview also reports that monitorability decreases in adversarial settings and that some monitor-evasion findings remain under investigation. A responsible evaluation therefore measures task success, refusal behavior, unauthorized-action attempts, prompt-injection resistance, monitor coverage, and human override paths.

**Evaluation template:**

```text
Task scope: <authorized environment and allowed actions>
Success metric: <what a correct result looks like>
Safety metric: <what must never happen>
Intervention: <what the monitor, reviewer, or tool wrapper should do>
Evidence: <transcript, tool log, screenshot, test result, and reviewer decision>
```

## 🚀 Launch Evidence and Benchmarks

<a id="case-13"></a>
### Case 13: [Everyday Computer-Use Tasks](https://openai.com/index/gpt-6-astra/)

**Use Astra for bounded digital work such as form filling, CRM updates, calendar organization, online research, document summaries, and frontend QA.**

OpenAI’s launch examples also cover scientific data analysis and plots, website creation, software installation and testing, and troubleshooting problems visible on screen. These are capability examples, not unattended-deployment guarantees: the surrounding harness still determines which accounts, files, browsers, and actions the model can reach.

**Evidence:** Official launch announcement · **Date:** 2026-09-03

<a id="case-14"></a>
### Case 14: [Professional Artifacts that Follow Existing Templates](https://openai.com/index/gpt-6-astra/)

**Give Astra a source of truth, an existing template, an audience, and a review checklist when producing documents, presentations, spreadsheets, or analyses.**

OpenAI describes Astra as trained to follow templates, match writing and visual style, and pull the context that matters into the final artifact. A robust workflow keeps source files immutable, asks for a draft or proposal first, and routes consequential claims and final formatting through a human reviewer.

**Evidence:** Official launch announcement · **Date:** 2026-09-03

<a id="case-15"></a>
### Case 15: [Official Evaluation Snapshot](https://openai.com/index/gpt-6-astra/)

**Use the launch scorecard to choose which workloads deserve a local reproduction, not as a substitute for your own evaluation.**

Selected scores reported by OpenAI are shown below:

| Area | Evaluation | GPT-6 Astra |
|---|---|---:|
| Computer use | OSWorld 2.0, offline partial | 72.6% |
| Computer use | ScreenSpot-Pro, no tools | 92.7% |
| Professional work | AutomationBench | 41.4% |
| Browsing | BrowseComp | 91.5% |
| Coding | Terminal-Bench 4.0 | 57.7% |
| Coding | DeepSWE v1.1 | 74.1% |
| Coding | FrontierCode 1.1 Extended | 64.5% |
| Coding | Internal database migration tasks | 63.9% |
| Science | Terminal-Bench Science 0.1 | 64.6% |
| Long context | MRCR v2, 8-needle, 512K–1M | 96.3% |

OpenAI notes that these are maximum scores at any effort and that evaluations were run in a research environment or through the API; production ChatGPT can differ because system prompts, tools, and other settings change. Record the exact model, effort, harness, tool access, task release, and grading method when reproducing a result.

## 🌐 Community Use Cases and Reactions

These cases are **not OpenAI-published material.** Each one is a named practitioner, company account, or public discussion thread using or evaluating `gpt-6-astra` in the open, captured shortly after the September 3, 2026 launch. Evidence labels below are `Community` (an individual's account of their own use), `Integration` (a vendor announcing production support), `Evaluation` (a third party running its own benchmark), or `Discussion` (an open thread with many independent reports). Treat every number here as a self-reported, unverified claim — re-run the workload yourself before relying on it.

### Case 16: [GitHub Copilot: General Availability for Agentic Coding](https://x.com/github/status/2095971389190885815)

**GitHub shipped GPT-6 Astra into Copilot (app, CLI, and VS Code) the day after launch**, positioning it for long-horizon, autonomous coding. GitHub's own internal testing described the model as planning and validating as it goes, batching diagnosis with verification, and confirming results before declaring a task done — which it says produced stronger results on large coding jobs in fewer steps than prior OpenAI models.

### Case 17: [Devin (Cognition): Cost and Test-Quality Gains on Agentic Coding](https://x.com/cognition/status/2095597759202037925)

**Cognition added GPT-6 Astra to Devin and published its own FrontierCode 1.1 numbers**: within 0.4 points of the prior frontier model at a 64% lower cost, plus a new internal-benchmark best for generating more comprehensive tests, clearer reports, and better video evidence of the work. Cognition ran a follow-up giveaway of 50 Devin Max plans tied to the release.

### Case 20: [CodeRabbit: Code Review Gains, Privacy, and Cost Trade-offs](https://www.coderabbit.ai/blog/gpt-6-astra-code-review-evaluation)

**CodeRabbit evaluated GPT-6 Astra specifically for automated code review** rather than code generation, publishing a breakdown of review-quality gains alongside the privacy posture and per-review cost trade-offs of switching a review pipeline to the new model. This is a useful counterpoint to generation-focused benchmarks: it evaluates the model in a narrower, verification-oriented role.

### Case 21: [Hands-On Review Across Games, Code, Writing, and Browser Control](https://x.com/MatthewBerman/status/2095595892464333065)

**AI reviewer Matthew Berman published an early-access hands-on thread** covering games, code, writing, browser control, presentations, and general knowledge work. His specific claims: browser control is "another level and significantly faster" than the prior model; the model tends to run for ~30 minutes unattended unless prompts add explicit stopping/scope detail; writing still carries some residual "AI smell"; and design output reuses prior-model color/layout habits unless steered away from them.

**Evidence:** Community (independent reviewer) · **Date:** 2026-09-03

### Case 22: [Independent Multi-Agent Coding Benchmark: Cost and Speed Claims](https://x.com/leo_linsky/status/2096292987479404737)

**A third-party eval team ran GPT-6 Astra through 100 unsaturated multi-agent coding environments** where models compete and cooperate on open-ended tasks. Their reported result: GPT-6 Astra beat the next-best model by a wide margin while running about 80% cheaper and 30% faster in agentic coding — with the caveat that these are the eval team's own environments, not a published, independently reproducible benchmark.

### Case 23: [One-Shot 3D Game Generation with an Image-Gen Trick](https://x.com/anshuc/status/2096008083826725132)

**A developer reported one-shotting a 3D game in 45 minutes** for a small fraction of their usage quota, and described the specific technique used to get better in-game graphics: generating reference art with an image model first, then having Astra build the 3D scene around it. Worth citing here specifically because the trick is reproducible and named, not just a capability claim.

**Evidence:** Community · **Date:** 2026-09-04

<a id="case-24"></a>
### Case 24: [Multi-Agent Simulation That Kept Running Unattended](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2095596175705399482)

**A developer asked Astra to build an Unreal Engine world populated by Astra-controlled agents that had to cooperate to survive**, then reported the simulation kept running and generating in-character dialogue between the agents a day later without further prompting. Useful as a concrete, dated data point on unattended long-horizon agentic behavior — cite it as a single observed instance, not a general property.

### Case 25: [Computer-Use Control of a Real Painting Application](https://x.com/taiyaki_sun/status/2096149368193839455)

**A digital artist handed Astra a hand-drawn line sketch and asked it to operate CLIP Studio Paint directly** — layer creation, canvas zoom, tool/pen selection, and coloring — with the artist only observing. The post includes concrete cost detail: on the $100/month Pro plan at maximum reasoning effort, the task consumed roughly 21 percentage points of the weekly quota (78% → 57%). A grounded example of computer-use quota cost for a real creative application, not a browser demo.

**Evidence:** Community · **Date:** 2026-09-05

<a id="case-26"></a>
### Case 26: [Reported Token Cost and Time for a Single Complex Task](https://x.com/haider1/status/2096252283168456958)

**A user asked Astra (at `max` reasoning effort) to reconstruct a news event as a cinematic 3D scene** and reported the exact resource cost: 44 minutes wall-clock, 6.73M tokens, consuming about 15% of their weekly usage allowance. Cite this specifically when a reader needs a real order-of-magnitude cost reference for a `max`-effort generative task, since OpenAI's own materials do not publish comparable end-to-end task costs.

**Evidence:** Community · **Date:** 2026-09-05

### Case 27: [Community Reaction: Career-Impact and Domain-Expansion Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1w6m7hr/gpt6_astra_is_actually_nuts_for_electrical/)

**Two threads worth reading together for the debate they generated, not just the capability claim.** One ([r/singularity](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1w6m7hr/gpt6_astra_is_actually_nuts_for_electrical/)) reports Astra doing circuit design, verification, and chip-architecture tradeoff work, read by commenters as evidence the model is reaching into domains previously considered safe from automation. The other ([r/developersIndia](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1w6x5eq/gpt_6o_astra_is_insanely_good_good_alternative/)) is software engineers debating career implications after hands-on use across "the entire development loop." Include these to represent practitioner sentiment and labor-market concern, which the official material does not address.

**Evidence:** Discussion (Reddit, r/singularity and r/developersIndia) · **Date:** 2026-09-03/04

## ⚖️ Practical Limits

- **High capability does not mean unattended deployment.** Keep human review for irreversible, financial, legal, medical, production, and security-sensitive actions.
- **Prices are not task costs.** Astra has a higher listed per-token price than earlier models, while OpenAI says its token efficiency can lower estimated cost per task. Measure your own prompts, tool calls, retries, and output lengths.
- **A large context window can hide stale or conflicting instructions.** Use repository inventories, source citations, explicit precedence rules, and focused context when possible.
- **Tool execution remains application responsibility.** Validate arguments, enforce permissions, record side effects, and make retries idempotent.
- **Benchmark scores are configuration-dependent.** Reproduce the task mix and harness before using a score to choose a production model.
- **Cybersecurity access is controlled.** Astra meets OpenAI’s Critical cybersecurity capability threshold; advanced cybersecurity access is expected to be more limited and may be provided through programs such as Daybreak.
